        <div class="card-text">
          When we look at a single honey bee we see a small, seemingly simple
          creature. But behind that modest frame is an incredible story. From
          the very start of its life, the bee has a fascinating journey.

          The queen spends her life, after her mating flights, laying eggs. She
          lays around 2,000 per day. The deciding factor as to whether an egg
          becomes a male or female is based on whether she fertilizes the egg.
          If she does so, she has laid an egg destined to be a worker or a queen
          i.e. a female. Otherwise the egg is destined to be a male bee - a
          drone.

        <p>
          The distinction between the two female castes - worker or queen - is
          made about three days after the transition to larvae i.e. about 6 days
          after the egg is laid. Workers, drones and queens are all fed royal
          jelly for their first three days as larvae. That diet is then stopped
          for both workers and drones. For queens, however, the royal (jelly)
          treatment is continued. Interestingly, the effect of this is not to
          "promote" queen-like characteristics, as many assume, but rather to
          inhibit the development of worker characteristics.

          As the pupa stage is reached and progresses, the bee within the capped
          cell starts taking a more recognizable bee form. Features such as
          eyes, legs and wings all develop and small hairs cover the bees body.

          Finally, at the appropriate time, the bee will chew its way out from
          the capped cell. As soon as they are free and moving away from the
          cell, worker bees will clean up the cell and prepare it for the next
          egg.

            The queen bee is the only female in the colony capable of
            reproduction. The queen lives an average of 3 years. The queen is
            the mother of all of the bees in the hive. She can lay up to 2000
            eggs a day! Some worker bees, called attendants, take care of the
            queen.

            Worker bees do all the work in the hive. They are responsible for
            collecting food and water, building comb, cleaning, raising larvae,
            protecting the hive, and caring for the queen.

            Drones are the only male honey bees in the colony. They take 24 days
            to grow from egg to adult and can live for 3 months. A drone’s only
            function is to mate with a queen from outside its hive.
